This folder contains all the HTML Documents Assignment files.

Included all of the following to finish the task:

Two different HTML files on a subject of your choosing. 
One file must contain an image and the other must contain a YouTube video.
Your code must use the <nav> element linking both HTML files. 
Your code must include a link to a Youtube video or an embedded Youtube video.
Your code must include an image.

Also added text border limits as it as annoying me.
